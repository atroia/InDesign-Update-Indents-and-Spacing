This script will update all styles that have Indents and Spacing values above 0 for Left, Right, First Line Indent, and Space Before. It also updates the Space After for one style I have called "break". The values will all be updated to either the font size or leading of [Basic Paragraph] that I base all my main text styles on and ignores the styles I have that use smaller font sizes and leading.

All paragraph style names besides [Basic Paragraph] are all based on my InDesign interior book design stylesheet paragraph styles.
